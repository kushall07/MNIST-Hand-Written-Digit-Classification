1. MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition with Keras:-

2. Importing the dataset using keras.datasets.

3. To work with keras API the array should be reshaped to 4-dimentions.

4. Importing the required keras modules and layers for creating a sequential model.

5. Add a layer to the NEURAL NETWORK and perform convolution operation ,max pooling, flattening.

6. fix some number of epochs and then run the algorithm and check the accuracy.

7. On increasing the no. of epochs more accuracy can be achived.

8. Accuracy obtained is 99%.
